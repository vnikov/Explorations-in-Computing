Click in this box, type a sentence, and hit the return key.  ELIZA will process your sentence, print a reply, and display a new text bos for your next input.\n",

    "IPython will let you type in any cell in the notebook at any time.  But if the Python kernel is busy with an ELIZA session it can't process other code cells.  So if IPython seems to be ignoring you, check other code cells to make sure there isn't an asterisk that shows the kernel is busy.  If you find one, and it's an interactive session with ELIZA, just type `quit`."
